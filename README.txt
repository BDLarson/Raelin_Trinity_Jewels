Summary:
    This game is set in a fictitious village, where you play girl whose sister
    has been kidnapped by an evil shadow king. You must fight your way through
    3 dungeons surrounding your village to collect ancient jewels. Once you have
    the 3 jewels, you can unlock the power that is hidden away at an old temple.
    Fight your way through enemies to save your sister and restore peace to the
    region.
